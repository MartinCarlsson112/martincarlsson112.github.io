                    <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">My name is Martin! I am currently a student at Futuregames,&nbsp;<br>previously graduated from Uppsala University Campus Gotland'&nbsp;Game Design and Programming with a bachelors degree in. On the side I am currently developing Goblin
                        Doctors and adding rendering features to my own game engine.<br><br>People's first impression of me is usually that I&nbsp;can be a bit quiet and a little bit reserved. But I am someone who grows in the team, as time goes on I
                        get more comfortable. I am generally known as a bit of a workaholic. I am always eager to take on tasks and I always try to commit to the team and find how I can be most beneficial to the team. While I can get attached to my own
                        work, the game and the team are always more of a priority for me.<br><br>My passion for developing games comes from working in a team, learning new things and experimenting game play system and new technologies. Although the projects
                        I've worked on have not all been successful, they have all helped me improve both as a programmer and as a person.<br><br>As a programmer I enjoy data-oriented design, and I think&nbsp; that understanding the hardware is important.
                        That said, I have plenty of experience in object-oriented languages and feel confident in writing clean code. My favorite part about game programming is debugging, tracking down and understanding elusive bugs is very entertaining
                        to me and especially rewarding if I can help fix them.</p>
