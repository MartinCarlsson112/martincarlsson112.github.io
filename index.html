      <p>The Hermit is a top down hack and slash game where you control some friendly forest minions. The minions help you in combat and are also useful to solve 
        puzzles in the way of the hermit! My role in this project was to implement the AI for the weasels. The ai technique used was Utility AI coupled with a state machine.
